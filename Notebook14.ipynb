    "This notebook is so big that it's being broken into two notebooks. We're going to do something pretty cool here, but it's got a bunch of moving parts. One of the key aspects of this notebook is that we need to be able to visualize our data. Our long goal is to be able to build a recommender system, and don't worry: I'll guide you through this. So long as you pay attention in class, you should be able to follow along. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pandas & Data Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the tools that we are going to need from pandas include the following. Here is the holistic [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.gt.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Get slices of columns and/or rows. [df.loc[VARIOUS FORMATS]](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.loc.html)\n",

    "* We might also need to bring our output into string format. [df.to_string()](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_string.html)\n",
    "* Might be helpful to see the shape of a df. [df.shape](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.shape.html)\n",

    "* Drop rows that have a Not a Number (NaN) value. [df.dropna()](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.dropna.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we need to consider what features we are going to use. Now, remember, that we want a system that will be able to compute a recommendation. Here we should pause and consider. Do we want qualitative or qantitative data? How would we compute either. Consider this [article](https://articles.outlier.org/discrete-vs-continuous-variables), which has some very helpful examples. To do so we need to keep in mind two different kinds of values. There can be discrete values and there can be continuous values.\n",
    "\n",
    "A discrete value is something that can be counted. \n",
    "\n",
    "A continuous value is something that must be measured. \n",
    "\n",
    "Considering this, we need to identify some features, and while you are doing this, I want you to consider the following: Why might `Age` be an especially unhelpful 'feature' for a recommender system. \n",
    "\n",
    "If then we can't use `Age`, what can we use? \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following: is a rating a discrete or a continuous value? Is there a way that we can measure the distance between two users? What if we didn't treat all users as equal? What do we do with missing values e.g. `NaN`?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization is well explained in the following article[Why Data Normalization is Necessary for Machine Learning Models](https://medium.com/@urvashilluniya/why-data-normalization-is-necessary-for-machine-learning-models-681b65a05029). In the introduction it states, \"Normalization is a technique often applied as part of data preparation for machine learning. The goal of normalization is to change the values of numeric columns in the dataset to a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values.\" (Jaitley, 2018). But let's think of a simple example. Imagine that we have the following data:\n",
    "\n",
    "| usr  | hours  | rating 0-10 |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| a  | 27  | 7  |\n",
    "| b  | 3  |  10 |\n",
    "| c  | 500  | 9  |\n",
    "| d  | 43  |  7 |\n",
    "| e  |  127 |  10 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine that we wanted to find a relationship between the hours a person plays a game and the rating. What you might notice is that the range for hours goes from 3-500 (and could perhaps go even further). You'll also note that the rating is locked in at 0-10. What will happen if we try and relate these two values? Well, the scales between the two are so radically different, that it's impossible to get reasonable ratios. If, however, we normalize, we can end up with a table that looks like this. For the moment we will assume that the minimums are `0` and the max is `500`. Let's transform this data with just a bit of simple math. \n",
    "\n",
    "| usr  | hours 0-1 | rating 0-1 |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| a  | .054  | .7  |\n",
    "| b  | .006  |  1 |\n",
    "| c  | 1  | .9  |\n",
    "| d  | .086  |  .7 |\n",
    "| e  |  .254 |  1 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, of course, this is a simple example, but it actually can be quite necessary in order for the numbers to be able to play together in an appropriate way. 0 to 1 is a common convention. What our normalized data reveals here is that there is in fact NOT a relationship between play time and rating. Can you explain why?"
